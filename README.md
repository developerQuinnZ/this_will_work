Gamify your bot training!

## Description

Can you tell the difference between a coyote and a wolf? A mouse and a squirrel? At night? What about their tracks? Are you master tracker material? With this game you can find out, and help the Cascadia Wild citizen science program at the same time. The more images you and your friends label the more data we have about the ecosystem on Mt Hood and nearby forests.

Did OR-7 spend any time near Hood? Are there surviving Montagne Fox hiding in some seculeded ravine? Will Wolverarines ever return to Hood? As you upload your images or just help label our database you can improve our data while honing your skills.

And if you can think of other applications for this software, or want to apply it to your own images, it has a REST API and is fully open science (open source and open data).
